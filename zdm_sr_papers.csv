If the relevance condition is met but the satisfaction condition fails, the system delivers a targeted feedback message. This approach allows students to follow any solution path as long as they do not violate constraints, promoting flexibility while ensuring correctness at each step.
SANYMS, a web-based homework system built on CBT principles, offers step-by-step feedback during algebra problem-solving. Students select an action (e.g., adding, multiplying, factoring) and input the resulting equation. If incorrect, they receive a prompt to retry before moving on, preventing error compounding. Unlike automated solvers, SANYMS keeps students in control of the solution process, requiring them to declare each step, which enables detection of correct answers achieved through incorrect reasoning. Integrated tools like a math keyboard minimize syntax errors, and the system ensures feedback is immediate, accurate, and aligned with the student’s chosen problem-solving path.",Students can choose problem-solving steps.,Students control the timing of feedback by choosing when to submit their work.,"the Constraint-Based Tutor (CBT) and SANYMS give learners control over their problem-solving process while providing structured, non-intrusive feedback. CBT allows students to follow any solution path as long as constraints are satisfied, while SANYMS builds on this by requiring students to select and name each step, ensuring they actively decide how to proceed. Immediate, step-level feedback prevents error compounding without taking over the solution process, and the system distinguishes between syntactical mistakes, incorrect applications, and valid but unexpected forms. This design encourages autonomy, metacognitive reflection, and ownership of learning, enabling students to construct solutions independently rather than passively receiving answers.",Correctness of each step and overall solution.,Not specified.,

CE demonstrate accurate solutions and help students learn efficient problem-solving strategies, while EE expose common mistakes and misconceptions, prompting learners to reflect and correct their reasoning. These examples are integrated into short interactive tasks and videos on a Moodle-based platform, supported by learning analytics (LA) to monitor progress and predict future performance. The feedback is formative, allowing teachers to intervene early and tailor instruction based on real-time data. Importantly, the effectiveness of CE and EE depends on students’ prior knowledge—those with lower initial understanding benefit more from CE, whereas differences diminish for higher-achieving students. This approach not only reinforces conceptual understanding but also provides teachers with actionable insights to personalize learning.",Students have flexibility over the learning pace and task completion.,Students have some control over feedback timing as they complete tasks at their own pace.,"The tool promotes student agency by enabling learners to work autonomously on short, interactive tasks through a Moodle-based platform, supported by Learning Analytics (LA). Students receive immediate feedback, can monitor their progress, and access explanatory videos, which fosters self-regulation and informed decision-making. LA provides real-time data that allows teachers to personalize instruction while empowering students to take ownership of their learning. The inclusion of correct and erroneous examples encourages reflection and deeper cognitive engagement, while the flexibility to complete tasks at their own pace enhances autonomy. Overall, this design combines adaptive feedback, transparency, and meaningful activities to create a student-centered learning environment that strengthens agency.","Pretest and posttest scores, student engagement metrics.",Agency is measured through student engagement and performance metrics on tasks.,

Verbal feedback delivered learning content and evaluations, while nonverbal cues—such as facial expressions, gaze direction, gestures, and voice modulation—were designed to convey empathy and stimulate interest in the task. Using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), the agents generated realistic facial expressions to appear empathic, which activated learners’ mirror neuron systems and fostered a sense of connection. This multimodal feedback aimed not only to correct or guide performance but also to boost extrinsic motivation and engagement, leading to improved accuracy and faster responses in learning tasks.",Student active partication and interaction with a virtual agent,Not specified,"virtual agents designed with empathic feedback significantly enhance students’ motivation and engagement. Using the VIB platform, the researchers compared a unimodal agent (verbal feedback only) with a bimodal agent (verbal feedback plus facial expressions based on the Facial Action Coding System). Children interacting with the bimodal agent achieved higher accuracy (84% vs. 74%), took more time to respond—indicating deeper cognitive engagement—and perceived the agent as more caring and supportive. These empathic cues encouraged students to persist longer and make extra effort, boosting their extrinsic motivation and sense of agency. The findings suggest that multimodal, empathic feedback humanizes digital learning environments, fostering active participation and improved performance even in familiar tasks.","Accuracy rates, reaction times, and questionnaire responses",Not specified,

As students draw segments or angles, the system instantly displays visual cues—turning elements green if correct or red if incorrect—so learners can actively infer why their responses are right or wrong. This immediate feedback supports performance and learning, particularly for novices, by guiding them toward accurate solutions without giving away full answers. The study found that this feedback was highly effective: students who received it not only performed better during practice but also showed significantly improved results on a subsequent paper-based transfer task, even without feedback. This demonstrates that real-time corrective feedback enhances short-term accuracy and fosters durable learning, helping students become more autonomous as guidance is gradually reduced.",Students are encouraged to regulate their own learning and reflect but feedback is controlled by the system.,Students do not control feedback timing; it is provided automatically by the system.,"The tool promotes student agency by enabling learners to actively monitor and regulate their own progress through real-time adaptive feedback. As students draw geometric shapes on the tablet, the AI system immediately signals correctness by turning segments or angles green if correct and red if incorrect. This instant, visual feedback allows students to identify and correct mistakes on their own, fostering autonomy and self-directed learning rather than relying on teacher intervention. The study emphasizes that this feedback encourages learners to engage in active reasoning—figuring out why an angle is right or wrong—and gradually improves their performance over time. Moreover, because students successfully applied what they learned to a paper-based transfer task without further feedback, the approach supports durable learning and independence. The authors argue that such adaptive guidance, combined with the possibility of tapering support as students gain expertise, helps transform novices into autonomous learners.",Success in drawing geometric shapes and angle differences.,Not specified.,relatively correct notes. It is a comparative study with 3 different groups for the interventon.  The tablet with feedback group outperformed the other 2 groups. The only feedback provided was corrective.
